# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-07
### Added & Fixed
- **Isolated Subprocess Architecture**: Spotify and Apple Music scrapers now run in isolated CLI instances (`--run-spotify`) to prevent memory crashes, zombie processes, and UI window cloning.
- **Universal Jittering (Anti-Ban)**: Random sleep intervals now apply to all searches, preventing YouTube IP blocks when downloading massive Spotify playlists via `ytsearch`.
- **Silent Engine**: CMD terminal windows are now completely hidden (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW`) during FFmpeg conversions, AI vocal extraction (Demucs), and data scraping.
- **Persistent Wallpapers**: Custom wallpapers (images and videos) are now securely stored in the internal application data directory (`AppData`/`/data`), surviving app restarts and downloads folder clearings.
- **Local Storage Bugfix**: Disabled `private_mode` in PyWebview to stop the engine from wiping user preferences (themes, language) on every application restart.
- **Frontend Build Optimization**: Solved a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) bug related to `getApiUrl` that crashed the UI in minified production builds.
- **Resilient Fallback**: Graceful error handling for empty search arrays (`list index out of range`) when facing soft YouTube IP blocks.

## [1.7.7] - 2026-06-01
### Fixed
- **Cookie Validation**: Added a fallback to ignore corrupt or invalid `cookies.txt` files to prevent the app from crashing during link parsing and searching.
- **Cookie Warnings**: Added explicit UI warnings when attempting to download tracks or playlists without authentication cookies.

## [1.7.6] - 2026-05-31
### Added
- **Magic Search Playlists**: Full support for scanning and fetching tracks from Spotify and Apple Music playlists using pseudo-playlist generation.
- **UI Warning**: Added an alert when downloading from Spotify/Apple Music explaining the 50-track limit for anonymous visitors.
- **Cover Image Cropping**: Automatically crop 16:9 thumbnails to 1:1 square ratio to remove white/black padding from album covers.

## [1.7.5] - 2026-05-31
### Added
- **Global Localization (i18n)**: Fully translated UI with dynamic switching between English (US), Spanish (ES), and Portuguese (BR).
- **Language Selector**: New flag-based language selector implemented inside the Settings Modal.
- **Robust Database Syncing**: Downloads not associated with a playlist (singles) are now reliably saved to the local SQLite database to prevent redundant re-downloads.
- **Video ID Reliability**: Refactored the data ingestion pipeline to fetch accurate `video_id` metadata directly from `yt-dlp` instead of request URLs.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- **100% Portable Architecture**: Migrated from Tauri to a single `.exe` executable powered by PyWebView, drastically simplifying distribution.
- **Proxy Survival Mode**: Integrated `proxyscrape` to auto-fetch free proxies, combined with 4 fallback clients (TV, Android, iOS, Web) to bypass YouTube IP blocks. Tested up to 1000+ continuous downloads.
- **Queue Memory**: App now remembers unfinished downloads using `localStorage` and prompts to resume them after a restart.
- **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Removed generic 500 errors. `yt-dlp` native errors (e.g., Age Restriction, Login Required) are now bubbled up to the UI.
- **UI Improvements**: Redesigned the cookies tutorial in the Settings modal to be more visual and intuitive.
- **Smart Build System**: Improved Python build script to generate a single portable executable using PyInstaller's `--onefile`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-01
### Added
- **Desktop Support (Tauri)**: Native desktop application built with Tauri (Rust) and React.
- **Acrylic Effects**: Glassmorphism and modern UI effects for Windows.
- **Custom Title Bar**: Integrated window controls (minimize, maximize, close) with native feel.
- **Production Installers**: Automated generation of `.exe` and `.msi` installers.
- **Sidecar Architecture**: Backend Python server bundled as a sidecar process.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-31
### Added
- **Persistent History**: Integrated SQLite database for tracking download status and history.
- **Smart Retry Pipeline**: Intelligent download strategy that cycles through formats, cookies, and clients (Web, TV, Android, iOS) to bypass "403 Forbidden" errors.
- **Redownload Feature**: Capability to re-enqueue failed or missing files directly from the history UI.
- **Polling Backend**: Switched from WebSockets to a robust polling mechanism for better stability on large queues.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-30
### Added
- **UI Refresh**: Modern, responsive design using Tailwind-like CSS variables and glassmorphism.
